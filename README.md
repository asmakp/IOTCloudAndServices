# Moisture Monitoring System
1.	Project description

The project aims at helping gardeners maintain their plants in good health by measuring the water content in the soil.
When the moisture levels are low or when the plants are not supplied with required amount of water, the soil moisture measuring 
system will remind the gardener to water the plants. Along with the moisture measurement the gardener is also provided with the weather
update about possibilities of rain or drizzle.
